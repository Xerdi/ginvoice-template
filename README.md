# GinVoice Template

An invoice template for the [GinVoice](https://gitlab.gnome.org/MacLotsen/ginvoice) application.

If you read about it in an article of MAPS or TUGboat, see the branches `maps` and `tugboat` instead.

## Usage

The current invoice template depends on a Python script `gingen`, which will be deprecated soon.
Currently, this version of the template won't be executable without GinVoice.
